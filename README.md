The one common issue which novice entrants in data science have always asked me is, "How to begin their data analysis journey?".
My answer has always been the same, "Tell a data powered story!". But, one will be in a position to tell a "story" only if he/she knows the *nuts and bolts* of the story. If you are a *novice* in statistics or applied mathematics, I recommend to check out the `resources` folder, first.

The repo contains `data, code, resources and plots` folders, for statistical and machine learning.
