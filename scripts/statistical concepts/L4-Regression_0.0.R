library(car) # to use the VIF()
vif(lm.fit) # VIF is used to detect multicollinearity among the predictors. 
# The smallest possible value of VIF is 1 which indicates complete absence of multicollinearity
# As a rule of thumb (ISLR book), a VIF value that exceeds 5 or 10 ndicates a problematic amount of multicollinearity
# The predictors rad (index of accessibility to radial highways) and tax (full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000.) are highly multicollinear with values greater than 5

# Method 1: remove one of the highly multicolinear variable and then compute the lm and vif

# Method 2: Use Partial Least Squares (PLS) or Principal Component Ananlysis (PCA) regression methods that cut the number of predictors to a smaller set of uncorrelated components.
#compute standard deviation of each principal component

boston.pca<- princomp(boston.new)

# To view the proportion of the total variance explained by each component, use the command summary()
summary(boston.pca)
# from the summary, we can see that 94% (Add the Proportion of variance for Comp.1 & Comp.2) is shown by the first two components
# To view the loadings use the command loadings()
boston.pca$loadings

#So, how do we decide how many components should we select for modeling stage ?
#The answer to this question is provided by a scree plot. 
#A scree plot is used to access components or factors which explains the most of variability in the data. It represents values in descending order.

# This plot shows that ~ 8 components explain maximum variance in the dataset. In other words we have reduced the predictors from 14 to 4
#Letâ€™s do a confirmation check, by plotting a cumulative variance plot. This will give us a clear picture of number of components.
