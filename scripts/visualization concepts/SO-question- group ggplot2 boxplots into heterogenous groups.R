# Solution # 2
# create a variable that groups your x variableâ€”the method depends on your data, but forcats::fct_collapse is one easy way to do this. Then use that to facet the plots. With facet_grid, you can set a free x-scale and free spacing, so that the panels are sized based on how many boxplots they each have.

                           labels = c("May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep"))

                                       "group 3" = c("Aug", "Sep")))
ggplot(air_groups, aes(x = Month, y = Ozone, fill = Month)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(group), scales = "free_x", space = "free")

# remove the facet labels.
