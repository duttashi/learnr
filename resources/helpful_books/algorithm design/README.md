My first degree is in biological sciences. The transition to computer science has not really been smooth sailing. I benefited much from online communities like `StackOverflow`, `StackExchange` and books. Like they say, "a good book at hand is your best friend."

Here, in this repository I share a few books that have helped me to understand the `design principles` on how things work. I found these books freely available on the internet. I have listed them below in no particular order of reading. 


- The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena, 2nd ed. [pdf](), [errata](http://www.algorist.com/algowiki/index.php/The_Algorithms_Design_Manual_(Second_Edition))
- Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al, 3rd ed. [pdf](), [errata]()
